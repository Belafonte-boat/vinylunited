    title1: "QUALITY"
    main1:  "Every service provided must respect the highest quality standards, both in terms
             of thought as for its execution. All this is done in the total respect of our clients’

    main3:  "We often suggest challenging and non-conventional solutions, but we believe in our
             ideas and we make sure to maintain always an independent point of view. It’s only
             by confronting ourselves with contrasting opinions that the best projects and the
             most useful services are created."
    title4: "RESPECT"
    main4:  "Even though innovation is a fundamental part of our DNA, we respect the heritage
            of thought and the history of all the Companies we work for. We know that true
            innovation in communication becomes effective when it implants itself in a coherent
            and soft way, without disrupting the Company’s original voice."
